# The Deep-Sea Gene Catalog (DSGC) and Deep-Sea Protein Fold Catalog (DSFC)

**Publication**: GUO Y., WANG Z., LI D., WANG L., et al. 2025. The genetic repertoire of the deep sea: from sequence to structure and function. Under review

The contents of the **GeneCatalog** directory primarily correspond to the section titled "The genetic diversity of deep-sea microbiomes" in the manuscript, and include the relevant analysis scripts and supporting files for this part of the study.  

The **COG_L** directory aligns with two key sections: "Habitat-dependent distribution of deep-sea microbial genes" and "Evolutionary forces and their impact on the genetic diversity of the deep sea", providing the scripts and data required for these analyses.

Files within the **StructureCatalog** directory support the section on "Structural homology of deep-sea proteins", and include structural analysis scripts and related resources.  

Lastly, the **Helicase** directory contains materials pertinent to "Structure-aided deep-sea bioprospecting", featuring the corresponding computational scripts and datasets used in this segment.  

### Companion Website:
The sequences and structures of the DSGC-DSFC dataset have been deposited and indexed at a new website (https://db.genomics.cn/exmode/collections/dsgc), and free online services are provided to easily manipulate and search for remotely homologous deep-sea genes and proteins of their interests.
