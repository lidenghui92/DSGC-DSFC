**Publication**: GUO Y., WANG Z., LI D., WANG L., et al. 2025. The genetic repertoire of the deep sea: from sequence to structure and function. Under review

### Companion Website:
The sequences and structures of the DSGC-DSFC dataset have been deposited and indexed at a new website (https://db.genomics.cn/exmode/collections/dsgc), and free online services are provided to easily manipulate and search for remotely homologous deep-sea genes and proteins of their interests.
