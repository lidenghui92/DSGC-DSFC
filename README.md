**Publication**: GUO Y., WANG Z., LI D., WANG L., et al. 2025. The genetic repertoire of the deep sea: from sequence to structure and function. Under review

### Companion Website:
The sequences, structures and related annotations of the DSGC and DSFC, as well as MAGs have been deposited at a new website under the CNGBdb (https://db.cngb.org/exmode/collections/dsgc), which also provided online services to easily manipulate and search for deep-sea genes and proteins of their interests.
